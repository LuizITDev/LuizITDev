I am currently an Information Security Intern at TransUnion, specializing in cybersecurity and software development. I’m passionate about combining my knowledge in InfoSec with software development, particularly in C# and .NET. I am also actively working on improving my skills in back-end development to contribute to building secure and efficient digital environments.

In addition to my professional interests, I am passionate about anime, manga, and practicing Jiu-Jitsu. Let’s connect and share knowledge on technology, cybersecurity, and innovation!
